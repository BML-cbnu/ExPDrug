# Deep Learning Model Utilizing Hierarchical Relationships between Genes and Pathways

## Quantitative Evaluation of Pathway Importance Using Explainable AI with Layer-wise Relevance Propagation

## Drug Discovery in Knowledge-based Graphs Using RWR (Random Walk with Restart) Based on Pathway Importance

### Workflow

1. **Preprocessing of Gene Expression Data**
2. **Generating Mapping Information**
   - Consider the hierarchical relationships between genes and pathways.
3. **Creating a Masking Matrix**
   - Use the generated mapping information.
4. **Filtering Pathways**
5. **Finalizing the Gene List and Pathway List**
6. **Running the Main Script**
   ```bash
   python main.py
