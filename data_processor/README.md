# Gene Pathway Mapping with HetioNet and Reactome

This repository contains scripts to filter pathway data from Reactome based on HetioNet pathways and map gene expression data to these pathways. The repository consists of two main scripts:

1. `get_filtered_pathway_info.py`: Filters Reactome pathways to include only those found in HetioNet.
2. `generate_pathway_mapping.py`: Maps gene expression data to the filtered pathways.

## Files

- `get_filtered_pathway_info.py`: Script to filter Reactome pathway data.
- `generate_pathway_mapping.py`: Script to map gene expression data to filtered pathways.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview and instructions.
